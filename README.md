# EmotiveCanvas

Emotive Canvas is a collaborative drawing application that allows users to create unique digital artwork through the use of facial expressions. This repository includes a multi-user mode, where each user is assigned a unique color for their doodles. The facial expressions of the users are used to determine the lineweight of their brushstrokes, and the resulting artwork is displayed on a shared canvas in real-time.

This drawing app provides a creative and non-verbal method of communication, allowing users to share their mood and enthusiasm through the use of indirect cues. It can be used as a tool for collaborative work, as well as a virtual whiteboard for brainstorming sessions.
